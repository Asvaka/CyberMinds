        <h2>Why is Cybersecurity More Critical <span class="blue-word">NOW</span> than Ever?!?</h2>
        <h3>Growing Cyber-Attacks</h3>

        <p>In recent years, the rate of <span class="yellow-word">cyberattacks</span> has skyrocketed <span class="green-word">exponentially </span>. The same amount of attacks that happened in a year in 2014 now happen in a single day in 2024.…This rapid increase in attacks is predicted to only worsen in the upcoming years.</p>
        <img class="graph1" src="/Images/graph1.png" alt="graph showing the icnrease of significant cyber attacks">

        <p>Surprisingly, the number of significant cyberattacks annually is now in the <span class="blue-word">billions </span>. With a shortage of Cybersecurity Professionals, it's really important to understand cybersecurity. The saying "it's always better to be prepared than sorry"always holds true…especially for CYBERSECURITY! 
        </p>

        <h3>Increased Costs</h3>
        <p>Hiring a cybersecurity professional may seem like a wonderful solution in <span class="green-word">certain scenarios....</span>             ….but the truth is that government spending on cybersecurity professionals has consistently increased over the years. Hackers are becoming <span class="blue-word">better hackers</span>, making defending a constant <span class="purple-word">challenge</span> for cybersecurity professionals.</p>

        <img class="graph2" src="\Images\graph2.png" alt="Graph showing an decrease, and then increase in the spending of US dollars (in billions)">
        <p>You may start to panic BUT please <span class="purple-word">don't panic</span>. This website will guide you through the process of protecting your devices from all attacks.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in exploring cybersecurity careers proceed to the <span class="yellow-word">next page,</span> otherwise head straight to <span class="purple-word">Course 2</span>. Remember, learning about cybersecurity is always <span class="green-word">beneficial</span>, even if it's not your <span class="blue-word"></span>primary focus!</p>
