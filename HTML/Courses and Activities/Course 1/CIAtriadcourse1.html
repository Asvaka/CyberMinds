        <h2>What is the CIA Triad</h2>

        <h3>Confedentiality</h3>
        <p>Confedentiality is the idea that a person's data can only be accessed by certain people can not those with malicious intent. For example, when you send a text message the only people are are able to read it are the sender and the recipient, because security measures are taken, such as encryption, to keep the data safe.</p>


        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>To have a security system with integrity essentially means to protect the data from being changed or tampered with, either accidently or on purpose. This is important so that customers can know that they can trust companies with their data. An example could be someone's personal health information. Data such as age or previous conditions are important factors to consider in patient care, and cannot be changed.  </p>

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>Availability ensures that the services and data are always available to the users. Users should be able to access their personal data easily with the security system still complying with the other 2 parts of the CIA triad. For example, </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <!-- add text here -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- add text here -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- add text here -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- add text here -->
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is the CIA Triad Important</h2>
        <p>With the world becoming increasingly more data-driven with more technological advancements, it is vital that the data used is kept secure. The dangers of a data breach can be severe, impacting both businesses and civilians. The CIA triad helps to avoid this because it offers a short, simple, comprehensive set of guidelines to maintain security. Even if someone isn't a security professional these guidelines can be universally understood. </p>
