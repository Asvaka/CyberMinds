        <h2>What is considered an attack in cybersecurity?</h2>
        <p>When people think of an <span class = "blue-word">attack in cyberspace</span>, what usually comes to mind is 
          a hacker in a dark room hidden behind a mask and their computer screen. However, attacks come in a <span class="blue-word">multitude of forms</span> 
          that range from hacking computer systems to mundane social interactions. </p>

        
        <p>A <span class = "blue-word">cyberattack</span> is an attempt to <span class = "blue-word">damage or gain access</span> to a computer system or 
          network, often with <span class = "blue-word">malicious intent</span>. Cyberattacks <span class = "blue-word">threaten the safety of digital 
            assets</span> and <span class = "blue-word">information</span> which can lead to <span class = "blue-word">financial or reputational 
              damage</span> for individuals and companies.</p>
        <p>An intrusion into a computer does not have to be successful for it to be considered an attack. Even a <span class = "blue-word">failed attempt</span>
           at hacking is enough for companies to begin troubleshooting system vulnerabilities that attackers find. An attack does not necessarily have to be 
           <span class = "blue-word">directly hacking</span> into a system either. Attackers sometimes uncover valuable information through everyday 
           conversations with people or through prior research of their target. </p>
           <p> This course covers the <span class = "blue-word">basic types of attacks</span> and <span class = "blue-word">attackers</span>, as well as their <span class = "blue-word">motives</span>. Letâ€™s get into it! </p>
