        <h2>What is a Phishing Attack?</h2>
        <p>
          A <span class="blue-word">phishing attack</span> is a
          <span class="blue-word">social engineering attack</span> in which the
          attacker deceives the victim into revealing personal information.
          <span class="blue-word">Phishing</span>
          usually involves some form of impersonation, increasing the chances
          that a victim will fall for the attack.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word"> Types of Phishing Attacks:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Traditional:</span> The most common
            phishing, sent through email
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Vishing:</span> Voice phishing, phishing
            over a phone call
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> SMishing:</span> SMS phishing, phishing
            through text conversations
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There are also
          <span class="blue-word">different types of phishing</span> depending
          on the target. For example,
          <span class="blue-word">Spear Phishing</span> is used when targeting
          an individual. Another example is
          <span class="blue-word">Whaling</span>, where a high-profile person,
          such as a CEO, is targeted.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span class="blue-word"> Characteristics of Phishing:</span>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Grammar/Spelling mistakes:</span> senders
            from a legit company are unlikely to make these mistakes to maintain
            professionalism
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Unknown sender:</span> this includes people
            who you have never contacted before or company names that are
            unfamiliar
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Suspicious links:</span> the domain or name
            of the website looks unfamiliar or not legit, never click on these
            types of links!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Suspicious attachments:</span> same deal as
            the suspicious links. If you are unsure that it is safe, do not
            click it!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Unrealistically good offers:</span> if
            something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Check for other
            signs of phishing and refrain from clicking anything phishy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Asking for personal information:</span>
            unless you know the company or person you are sending it to, never
            send out your personal information
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word"> Urgent or threatening tone:</span> this
            goes back to the principles of social engineering. Urgency and
            intimidation are used by attackers to get people to do what they
            want, beware of this!
          </li>
        </ul>
