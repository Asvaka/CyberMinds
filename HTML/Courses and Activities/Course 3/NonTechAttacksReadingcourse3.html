        <h2 class="larger">Types of Non-Technical Attacks</h2>
        <p>
          While it is easy to think that
          <span class="blue-word">cybersecurity</span> is limited to computers,
          it is important to remember that what happens in the real world has
          effects on the digital world. For instance, think about servers that
          need to stay unharmed for computer systems to function, these need to
          be physically protected. Another example is a credit card, knowing the
          <span class="blue-word">numbers</span> on the back can allow attackers
          to bypass <span class="blue-word">authentication systems</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some
          <bold><span class="blue-word">attacks</span></bold> that threat actors
          use to gain access to this information:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="smaller">
            <span class="blue-word">Shoulder Surfing:</span> the name refers to
            “looking over someone's shoulder” in order to gain information, such
            as watching someone type in the passcode to their phone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="smaller">
            <span class="blue-word">Dumpster Diving:</span> looking through
            trash in search of information. This can include looking through a
            computer's recycled files.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="smaller">
            <span class="blue-word">Tailgating:</span> Following someone with
            access to gain access to a facility. While this sounds like it would
            be easy to spot and report, attackers who tailgate often blend in to
            seem like they work at the facility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="smaller">
            <span class="blue-word">USB Baiting:</span> leaving a malicious USB
            drive out in the open for someone to find. Upon plugging these
            drives in, they can damage a user's computer. Remember not to plug
            anything suspicious into your devices unless you know where it is
            from!
