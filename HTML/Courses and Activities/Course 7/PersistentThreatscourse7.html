      <p>
        <span class="blue-word">A persistent threat or attack is one that maintains continuous access to its target once
          it has been exploited.</span>
        This means that
        <span class="blue-word">initial exploitation is only performed once</span>
        . Persistent attacks
        are often aided by malware and this type of attack is able to stay
        <span class="blue-word">undetected for long periods of time</span>
        , otherwise this attack would not be possible. <br><br> Here are some types of malware/concepts related to
        persistence:
      </p>

      <h3>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT):</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="blue-word">An APT is a type of persistent threat actor.</span>
        Their ability to stay
        <span class="blue-word">undetected</span>
        is what makes them
        <span class="blue-word">"advanced"</span>
        . A lot of APTs are
        <span class="blue-word">highly experienced</span>
        and may work for states.
      </p>

      <h3>Backdoor:</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="blue-word">A backdoor is the concept of continuous access to high privilege accounts, usually the
          root account.</span>
        The exact software used to carry out these attacks is known as a
        <span class="blue-word">rootkit</span>
        . Rootkits are
        meant to enable
        <span class="blue-word">long-term access</span>
        to systems. In a sense, they allow persistent attackers to
        <span class="blue-word">blend into the system</span>
        .
      </p>

      <h3>Remote Access Trojan (RAT):</h3>
      <p>
        In course 3, we very briefly talked about Trojan attacks.
        <span class="blue-word">A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a type of malware that is disguised as unharmful
          software.</span>
        Similarly, a
        <span class="blue-word">remote access Trojan</span>
        is a malware that aids in persistence attacks. Like its name implies,
        <span class="blue-word">RATs</span>
        function like
        <span class="blue-word">backdoor attacks</span>
        ,
        <span class="blue-word">granting root privileges remotely</span>
        , also for
        <span class="blue-word">extended periods of time</span>
        .
