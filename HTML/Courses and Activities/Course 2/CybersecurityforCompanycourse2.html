        <h2>The Importance of Cybersecurity for Companies</h2>
        <p>While companies have more robust security systems, they can still be attacked. Companies can be targeted by competitors looking to gain an advantage or by cybercriminals seeking the company’s money. It is vital that companies protect themselves from cyberthreats because attacks against them can affect the people they serve. Without proper security, people will not trust companies to handle their data. Both parties can suffer a financial loss or theft of personal data with companies being especially vulnerable to reputational damage. 
        </p>

        <h3>Actions that Companies Take:</h3>

        <p>You will learn about more defensive measures in course 4, but here are some topics to get you started:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="blue-word">Training/Awareness:</span> training that companies provide their employees or even their clients on security prevents people from making blunders that can risk the companies welfare. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="indigo-word">Intrusion Detection Tools:</span> Companies use tools to warn them of intrusions or suspicious activity on their systems
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="pink-word">Policies:</span> Both company policies and mandatory policies levied by the government improve the security of company systems
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- add text here -->
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Frameworks: </h3>
        <p> <span class="blue-word">A framework in cybersecurity is a model that dictates how companies should respond to security incidents. There are a variety of frameworks that companies can choose to use, some of them being a company’s own framework. </span>In the following example, we will look at the <span class="purple-word">NIST CSF.</span></p>

        <p> <span class="blue-word">NIST </span>is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and they created the <span class="pink-word">NIST CSF</span> , or the <span class="indigo-word">NIST Cybersecurity Framework </span>. This is one of the most popular frameworks used by organizations. This is the NIST CSF:</p>
        <img class="nist-csf" src="/Images/nist-csf.png" alt="nist csf frameword, it tells people to detect, respond, recover, identify and detect.">
        
        <h3>Stages of the NIST CSF:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="purple-word">Identify:</span> identifying assets and areas in a systems where attacks can occur</li>
          <li> <span class="blue-word">Protect:</span> taking necessary measures to protect assets and seal attack vectors in preparation for possible attacks</li>
          <li> <span class="pink-word">Detect:</span> once an attack occurs, the source of the attack and areas of the system that were affected must be detected</li>
          <li><span class="indigo-word">Respond:</span> containing the attack and its effects to a certain area and eliminating the attack</li>
          <li> <span class="purple-word">Recover:</span> restoring the system back to its original state, fixing vulnerabilities that led to attack, reflecting on what could have been done better</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mandatory Security Policies</h2>

        <p>Unlike individuals, businesses and companies that handle their clients’ data are required, by law, to follow certain policies. Refusal to adhere to these can result in fines which can hinder an organization’s productivity. </p>

        <h3>HIPAA:</h3>
        <p>	<span class="blue-word">The Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act</span> applies to all organizations that handle private health information of individuals. Organizations that adhere to HIPAA cannot share an individual’s health information to anyone else. </p>
        
        <h3>GDPR:</h3>
        <p><span class="pink-word"> The General Data Protection Regulation</span> protects the data of any EU citizen, regardless of whether or not they are in the EU. Their data cannot be used or shared without their consent. </p>

        <h3>PCI DSS:</h3>
        <p>The <span class="indigo-word">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</span> dictates how companies should protect credit card information. This is especially relevant with major credit card companies.</p>

        <h3>GLBA:</h3>
        <p>	The <span class="blue-word">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</span> requires all financial services or organizations handling financial information to share how they handle their clients’ data. This includes insurance and financial advice companies.</p>
